== Prereqs

The user will need to provide the following:

- Aws ssh key for the bastion
- AMI Ids for Rhel 8 and Rhcos images

== Step 1
Download the git to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/CodeSparta/devkit-vpc.git
cd devkit-vpc
- Setup your variables.tf
vi variables.tf

- exec into the container and deploy
bash tools/dev.sh
./devkit-build-vpc.sh -vv -e aws_access_key=xxxxxxxxxxxxx -e aws_secret_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -e aws_cloud_region=us-gov-west-1
    

```

== Step 2
To destroy the IaC run:
```
cd into git repo
bash tools/dev.sh
./breakdown.yml -vv
```
All resources not created from the IaC must be deleted prior to destroying the vpc.
